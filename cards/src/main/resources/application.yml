# Because of spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency, we can refresh the application settings at runtime but
# we have to use the POST request for all microservices one by one thanks to spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp dependency
# http://localhost:9000/actuator/busrefresh (POST request) we are just one time refreshing all microservices instances
# and config service will load the latest config data without restart via massage broker(rabbitmq) trigger change event action


## now we use all config and profile settings on configserver
